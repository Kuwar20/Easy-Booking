* Note
```text
For running this project locally, note that certain functionalities will be unavailable due to the absence of environment variables
file specified in the .gitignore file to exclude sensitive information like API keys, Database URI. Ensure you have the necessary
configuration in your local environment.
```
## Backend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `backend` folder and create two files: `.env` and `.env.e2e`. Add the following contents to both files:

   ```bash
    MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=

    JWT_SECRET_KEY=
    FRONTEND_URL=

    # Cloudinary Variables
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

    # Stripe
    STRIPE_API_KEY=
    ```
## Frontend Configuration

1. **Environment Files**: Navigate to the `frontend` folder and create `.env` file. Add the following contents to both files:

   ```bash
    #FRONTEND_URL
    VITE_API_BASE_URL=

    # Stripe
    VITE_STRIPE_PUB_KEY=
    ```

## Service Worker & Offline Functionality

This project now includes a service worker to enable offline functionality. The service worker caches key assets and API calls, ensuring the app remains usable even when the user is offline.

In the production build, the service worker is bundled with the frontend and properly registered, allowing users to view previously loaded data while offline. This is especially useful for a booking app, as it helps maintain a seamless user experience during network disruptions.

### Key updates:
- Added service worker logic in `src/sw.ts`
- Implemented service worker registration via `src/registerServiceWorker.ts`
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to handle service worker files properly

For local testing, you can simulate offline behavior using the browser's developer tools to verify the app's offline capabilities.
